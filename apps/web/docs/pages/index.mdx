## Development
### Steps for running local environment
1. Clone repo
2. Run `docker-compose up -d`
### Opening a PR
Some good advice from [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/git/written-unwritten-guide-pull-requests):
>Making smaller pull requests is the #1 way to speed up your review time. Because they are so small, itâ€™s easier for the reviewers to understand the context and reason with the logic.
### Common commands using the Last CLI
Here is an example of claiming a planet:
```javascript
var oldUnload = window.onbeforeunload;
window.onbeforeunload = function() {
    saveCoverage();
    if (oldUnload) {
        return oldUnload.apply(this, arguments);
    }
};
```
