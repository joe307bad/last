# Hey There Mr ascas Burp
In this guide youâ€™ll mainly be focusing on the sourcing of data and learning how **[Contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer)** works rather than how to make a pretty looking website.

## **What is Contentlayer?**

> Note: Contentlayer still in development and some APIs might change!

**[Contentlayer](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer)** turns your content into data - making it super easy to import MD(X) and CMS content in your app.

You can find the [full documention for Contentlayer here](https://www.contentlayer.dev/docs).

I'm looking forward to seeing the adoption of Content Layer as it will be on stable version.
