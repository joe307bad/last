## In page table of contentsdd
- Using `@joe307bad/rehype-toc`, we can debug an implementation of replacing a placeholder text (eg. TABLE_OF_CONTENTS) to a TOC
- The `@joe307bad/rehype-toc` will only run if there is no `.next` cache in `dist/apps/web/docs/` (so this may have to be deleted in order to debug)
## Navigation brainstorm
- Documentation - set up development environment and building blocks of application
- Architecture - explanation of each project in the monorepo
  - List of services that leads to a status page of services and past issues
- [is this link clickable](https://aws.com)

## Development
### Steps for running local environment
1. Clone repo
2. Run `docker-compose up -d`
### Opening a PR
Some good advice from [Atlassian](https://www.atlassian.com/blog/git/written-unwritten-guide-pull-requests):
>Making smaller pull requests is the #1 way to speed up your review time. Because they are so small, itâ€™s easier for the reviewers to understand the context and reason with the logic.
### Common commands using the Last CLI
Here is an example of claiming a planet:
```javascript
var oldUnload = window.onbeforeunload;
window.onbeforeunload = function() {
    saveCoverage();
    if (oldUnload) {
        return oldUnload.apply(this, arguments);
    }
};
```
